# gdp-expectancy
This is a Codecademy Data Analyst Career Path milestone, the Life Expectancy and GDP Portfolio Project. It's designed to be a group project, but I don't have a group to work with yet so it's just me.

**The Overview of the assignment is:**

For this project, you will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, youâ€™ll be creating a blog post to share your findings on the World Health Organization website.

**Project Objectives:**
